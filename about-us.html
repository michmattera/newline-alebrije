                <p>We are an organization that provides alebrije all around the world since
                    <strong>1936</strong>.
                    <strong>Pedro Linares López</strong> , our founder originally from Mexico City one day fell ill,
                    lost consciousness and fell into a deep sleep, when he was 30 years old.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sick and without access to doctors who could treat his <strong>illness</strong>, his sisters tried
                    to make him react with home remedies to no avail.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In his sleep, Pedro dreamed of a strange and interesting place, very peaceful, something like a
                    forest in which there were trees, rocks, and animals; he could see the clouds and the sky of that
                    magical scene.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He felt that everything was calm, he did not experience any pain and was happy to be
                    walking in that place; however, suddenly, the animals turned into <strong>strange
                        creatures</strong>;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They were animals that he could not distinguish because they were very rare. Don Pedro saw a
                    donkey with wings, a rooster with bull's horns, and a lion with the head of a dog.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All those animals
                    shouted a single word in unison: <strong>Alebrijes!</strong> They yelled louder and louder:
                    Alebrijes, alebrijes, alebrijes!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pedro continued on his way in that fantastic dream and while he was walking along a stone path he
                    saw a man walking calmly and asked him for help to get out of that place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The man replied that he shouldn't be there yet and that he had to keep walking because there was
                    an exit a few meters away.
                    Pedro ran and ran until he was facing a narrow window that he could barely squeeze through, at which
                    point he woke up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pedro was fully recovered and from then on he began his journey to find a way to go there and a way
                    to bring alebrije to our world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He did in <strong>1960</strong> when his <strong>first alebrije passed to the other side.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From that day on he delivers these spiritual guides to the other side every year, making this
                    company
                    and him the <strong>only one</strong> that can <strong>work</strong> and has a company in the
                    <strong>underworld.</strong>
