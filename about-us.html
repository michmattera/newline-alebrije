            <p>We are an organization that provides alebrije all around the world since
                <strong>1936</strong>.
                <strong>Pedro Linares López</strong> , our founder originally from Mexico City one day fell ill,
                lost consciousness and fell into a deep sleep, when he was 30 years old.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sick and without access to doctors who could treat his <strong>illness</strong>, his sisters tried
                to make him react with home remedies to no avail.
                <br>
                <br>
                In his sleep, Pedro dreamed of a strange and interesting place, very peaceful, something like a
                forest in which there were trees, rocks, and animals; he could see the clouds and the sky of that
                magical scene.
                <br>
                <br>
                He felt that everything was calm, he did not experience any pain and was happy to be
                walking in that place; however, suddenly, the animals turned into <strong>strange
                    creatures</strong>;
                <br>
                <br>
                They were animals that he could not distinguish because they were very rare. Don Pedro saw a
                donkey with wings, a rooster with bull's horns, and a lion with the head of a dog.
                <br>
                <br>
                All those animals
                shouted a single word in unison: <strong>Alebrijes!</strong> They yelled louder and louder:
                Alebrijes, alebrijes, alebrijes!
                <br>
                <br>
                Pedro continued on his way in that fantastic dream and while he was walking along a stone path he
                saw a man walking calmly and asked him for help to get out of that place.
                <br>
                <br>
                The man replied that he shouldn't be there yet and that he had to keep walking because there was
                an exit a few meters away.
                Pedro ran and ran until he was facing a narrow window that he could barely squeeze through, at which
                point he woke up.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pedro was fully recovered and from then on he began his journey to find a way to go there and a way
                to bring alebrije to our world.
                <br>
                <br>
                He did in <strong>1960</strong> when his <strong>first alebrije passed to the other side.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                From that day on he delivers these spiritual guides to the other side every year, making this
                company
                and him the <strong>only one</strong> that can <strong>work</strong> and has a company in the
                <strong>underworld.</strong>
