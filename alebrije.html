                <div class="child-central-section">
                    <p>An alebrije is a mix of 2 or more animals in one. They can be found just in the realm of death
                        and
                        can be brought into our world just on the day of death ( the 2nd of November).
                        <br>
                        They also have to match with a person before passing to the other world, otherwise, they would
                        be
                        lost in that world forever.
                        <br>
                        They can be divided into different categories:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Water</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Fire</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Earth</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Air</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        Each one has different powers, but they all have in common their purpose ( Helping
                        the person that they match with and guide them in life).
                        <br>
                        After you complete the form you will know which kind of alebrije you are going to get.
                        <br>
