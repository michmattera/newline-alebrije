The main color is #ff914d named bright orange and is complemented by #252441 named royal curtsy that is a dark shade of blue-magenta.

Those two color were chosen based on the Day Of The Death.

The main colors infact of that day are orange/purple/black .

 I choose the orange as the main color because I wanted to represent that day and at the same time because is the color that more represent mexico and <em>"The day of the death".</em>

The last color used was a darker white the #FAF9F5 used for the background of all the pages and the contrast on the dark theme .

The two main fonts are :
