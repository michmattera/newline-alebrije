## Design
### Color Palette
The main colors for the website were chosen with [Colourmind](http://colormind.io/template/material-dashboard/) palette generator.


<details>
<summary>Colour Palette</summary>

![Colour Palette](assets/css/images/read.me-images/Colormind-Palette.PNG)

</details>
The main color is #ff914d named bright orange and is complemented by #252441 named royal curtsy that is a dark shade of blue-magenta.

Those two color were chosen based on the Day Of The Death.

The main colors infact of that day are orange/purple/black .

 I choose the orange as the main color because I wanted to represent that day and at the same time because is the color that more represent mexico and <em>"The day of the death".</em>

 The 2nd of November is celebrated all over the world but especially in Mexico.

The last color used was a darker white the #FAF9F5 used for the background of all the pages and the contrast on the dark theme .

### Typography
The typography was chosen with google fonts.

The two main fonts are :
-  'Arapey'
- 'Work Sans'

That go back to safe fonts as :

- 'Serif'
- 'Sans-serif'

If the page or the browser are not compatible with the first two then it will change for "Serif" and "Sans-serif".
