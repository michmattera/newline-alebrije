## Introduction
This is a website set in a fantasy world, where exists the **alebrije**, an animal found in the world of death, that is a spiritual guide. Is a website of a company that can match you with an alebrije from the other world and sends it to your house or a specific location.

On this website, you are going to get information about the alebrije, the company, and what you have to do to get your spiritual guide.

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to use all the technologies learned so far, **HTML5** and **CSS3**. 
Data is presented to help users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service in which they are interested. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.

- In this case, the goal of the user is to know more about alebrijes and get one by completing a form.
- The goal of the company is to get the user to complete the form so they can give as many alebrijes as users that fill out the form. Give more information to the previous user about alebrije, the company, and contact details in case the user needs help.

## Features

### Used Features
- Header = The header is composed of the name of the company and a logo( that is a mix between a horse and a bird like an alebrije) to give identity to the company throughout all the pages.
- Navigation links = Navigation links are at the top of every page, to help the user to go to a different or specific page, and for easy navigation.
- Buttons and links =  They are used to go to a specific section within the same page or to a specific section on a different page to facilitate the user to find the section that he is interested in easily.
- Images and videos = They are used to give the user visive stimulation. Or another option is to follow the steps or the information without reading through everything. 
I used embedded youtube videos to explain a few more steps to follow.
- Embed map = Used an iframe from google Maps for the location of the pick-up point for the alebrije.
- Social media = Used social media icon on a non-static footer to give the possibility for the user to follow us on Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, and the GitHub developer account, with related content about alebrijes and purchase of alebrijes in real life. - Icons = The icons were chosen from the free [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free) website representing the different social media.
- Contact info = Used to give the user the possibility to contact for any information or alebrijes related problems.
- Congratulation page = To let know the user that the form was submitted correctly and to thank the user.
- 404 page = To let know the user that there was an error. Give the user a very small background story that they are in the wrong place, and a button to go to the homepage.
- 500 page = Same as the 404 error page.

### Common Features
- All pages header is at the top of the page, is static, and is composed by:
    1. Logo (Made with canva)
    2. Name of company (Searched based on alebrije in [Businessnamegenerator](https://businessnamegenerator.com/))
    3. Navigation links to other pages (At the top of the page)
    4. The first three pages are composed of a text-image section. The image occupies 2/3 of the width of the page, and a text section occupies 1/3 of the page. The image and text change from right to left from one section to another to give movement to the page.
    5.  The first 4 pages have a button represented by an arrow that points to the right at the bottom of the page, just before the footer that brings the user to the next page without having to scroll up and find the navigation links to go to the next page.
    6. A four-column section with the main title, is needed to go to a different page or another section on the same page. It can be with images to get the user's attention or just with a brief explanation of the specific section.
    7. All footer pages are composed by:
    -  Icons that link to social media

## Design
### Color Palette
The main colors for the website were chosen with [Colourmind](http://colormind.io/template/material-dashboard/) palette generator.


<details>
<summary>Colour Palette</summary>

![Colour Palette](/assets/images/read-me-images/Colormind-Palette.PNG)

</details>
The main color is #ff914d named bright orange and is complemented by #252441 named royal curtsy which is a dark shade of blue-magenta.

Those two colors were chosen based on the Day Of The Death.

The main colors in fact of that day are orange/purple/black/dark blue .

 I choose orange as the main color because I wanted to represent that day and at the same time because is the color that is more represented in Mexico and <em>"The day of the death".</em>

 The 2nd of November is celebrated all over the world but especially in Mexico.

Another color used was a darker white the #FAF9F5 used for the background of all the pages and the contrast on the dark theme.

The last color used was #E9E8E5 named = Narvik, used just on the botton in the text-side. Just to give the user a better UX experience , this color was chosen hovering over #FAF9F5, to not contrast too much the original color.


### Typography
The typography was chosen with google fonts.

The two main fonts are :
-  'Arapey'
- 'Work Sans'

That goes back to safe fonts as :

- 'Serif'
- 'Sans-serif'

If the page or the browser is not compatible with the first two then it will change to "Serif" and "Sans-serif".

### Visuals
For the visual stimulation of the user is used different images and videos.
There are different types of images used throughout the site:

1. [Artistic images](#Artistic-Images)
2. [Real images](#Real-Images)
3. [Youtube videos](#Youtube-Videos)

#### Artistic images
Artistic images throughout the site were token from [Art Station](https://www.artstation.com/search?sort_by=relevance&query=alebrije), they were selected for the alebrije's and for the positiob of the company in the underworld.

The following images were token from :
- [Jolanda Van Zandbergen](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/WmBmGy) = Used for the "Earth Alebrije".
- [Emylie Boivin](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lVNwWV) = Used for the "Fire Alebrije".
- [Hadas Gold](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ybNBbJ) = Used for the "Air Alebrije".
- [Kadjugan](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6aoZP6) = Used for "Water Alebrije".

- [Daniela Henríquez](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qQJQQL) = Used for the "Homepage first image".
- [Fogwind](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ykrVy5) = Used for the "Are you lost section".
- [Leon Tukker](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/nkqro) = Used for the "Company location". 
- [Quentin Laville](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/A9yzZ5) = Used for the "Form page left picture".
- [Juan D. Campos](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lVPQYa) = Used for the "Form page right picture".
- [Marlyn](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/14LrRL) = Used for "Congratulation message".

#### Real Images
The other images were used to represent real scenarios or objects.

 For example candles, pan de Muerto, and celebration of the day of death. And they were taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/photos/search/?manual_search=1), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), and the movie "Coco" for the about us section on the homepage.

 #### Youtube videos
 Youtube videos were used mainly to help the user with the steps to complete.

 They are both on the steps page and help the user to:
 1. To prepare the <em>altar </em>for the arrival of the alebrije.
 2. To cook and prepare the <em>Pan De Muerto</em>.


## Issues and Bugs

Many different issues and bugs were encountered by the developer throughout the project.
Below a short list of the most important bugs and issues found , along with solutions for them :

- **responsive images** = When changing the size of the screen most of the images were just disappearing from the screen. The problem was that there was the % of the container but not an exact height set to the child , making all content disappearing.

 Resolved : By searching in [Stack-Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) .

- **Link to go to map** = A bug was found when clicking on the link on the homepage that should go directly to the section of the map was bringing just to the map page, not the map section. 

Resolved: The anchor was bringing to the first image of the about-us.html because the name of the image was the same as the id given to the map section. Changed the name from location to map and it resolved the issue.

- **Left side space** = An issue was found when checking responsive devices. There was a very small blank space on the right side of the page.

Resolved: Controlling and hovering each element on the page, the error was then found on the margin of the navigation menu, which was causing all the elements in the page to have this extra white space. Eliminated the margin to eliminate the issue.
