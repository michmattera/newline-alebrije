                    <br>
                    From a specific location in Mexico, a portal and a magical bridge made out of :

                    A yellow flower that is very common in Mexico, open just on that day.
                    <br>
                    From that bridge, you will see arrive your Alebrije, and if you want as well your relatives from
                    the other world.
                    That is why you will have to be patient and wait for that day.

            <h2 class="main-title blue">Make an altar!</h2>
            <p>You will have to make an altar to make a connection with the other world so that your alebrije (and as
                well the people you lost)
                can pass the bridge and arrive at your house safely.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Altar</h3>
            <p>An altar is a place where you make a connection with the other world. You do it using the four elements,
                like the elements
                of the alebrijes: <strong>Air</strong>, <strong>Fire</strong>, <strong>Earth</strong>, and
                <strong>Water</strong>.
                It is usually in your house and is divided into three different levels that represent: Heaven, Earth and
                the World of the Death.
                I am going to show how to make an altar in different steps or if you want you can follow the video
                below!

                <li class=" list">
                    <h4 class="list-title">Base of the altar</h4>
                    <p>The base on the altar is what you are going to use to prepare the
                        altar in your house or where you have decided to wait for your alebrije.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can simply use a table or a desk for the first and central levels.
                        <br>
                        To do the top level you can place any object that can sustain weight
                        for example a box or a few books together.
                        <br>
                        For the third and bottom level, you can use a box or even old luggage will be okay.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The most important thing is that all the surfaces are flat. Now you can cover all the surface
                        with
                        what you have in your house. You can either
                        use a blanket
                        or you can buy something related to the day of the dead!
                        <br>
                        Just have fun and use something you like!

                    <p class="around-image">
                        This flower, which grows mostly in October and November according to traditions, is also
                        called the flower of the dead, flower of the twenty petals, or cempasuchil flower.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is considered since pre-Hispanic times as a symbol of life and death.
                        <br>
                        You are going to need this flower and the petals of the cempasúchil flower to create paths and
                        guide the alebrije and the deceased to the altar that you are building.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is a flower that <strong> connect </strong> the open portal from the realm of death to the
                        mortal world to your house.
                        It also represents the first element on our altar the <strong>Earth</strong>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That is why you need this flower on your altar and why is so important.
                        <br>
                        You can place the flowers a bit everywhere on the altar but the important part is that you make
                        a path with
                        the petals from the altar for at least 1 meter.

                        The papel picado is a typical mexican decoration made out of <strong>paper
                            "Papel"</strong> and <strong>"Picado"</strong> that
                        means <strong>chopped.</strong>
                        <br>
                        Inside the paper is carved out to create different designs, usually something related with the
                        underworld.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The papel picado in the altar represents the <strong>Air</strong> element.
                        <br>
                        Each chopped paper has different colors and different meanings.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Orange represents mourning; purple refers to the Catholic religion; blue refers to the
                        deceased who had a death related to water; red is for warriors or women who died during
                        childbirth;
                        green is for young people; white, for children; yellow, for the elderly; and black
                        symbolizes the underworld.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So you can decorate the altar with this papel picado, you can use it on your table , in the
                        roof, behind the altar, or just on the table.
                        <br>
                        The important is just using this element so you have your first element in place.

                        <br>
                        The fire is needed for two important reasons:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Candles for <strong>Guide</strong>
                        <br>
                        - Incense for <strong>Purification</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It guides the alebrije home or where your altar is without the risk of getting lost.
                        <br>
                        And it purificate the air so that there is no risk of entering and arriving from the other side
                        to the altar.

                    <p>The last element on our altar is the drinks, which represent our last element the
                        <strong>Water.</strong>
                        <br>
                        You can place whatever beverage you like on the altar, the important is that is liquid.
                        <br>
                        We put the liquid on the ofrenda so the alebrije and the deceased once arrived at our
                        destination
                        can

                The first one is <strong>Pan De Muertos</strong>( the brad of the dead) a Mexican dish and the favorite
                dish of alebrijes.
                <br>
                The second one is your favorite dish. that is because when you match with your alebrije you actually
                share all
                your passions and your soul. One of the common elements that is always shared with your spiritual guide
                is your favorite dish,
                that is the first thing you and your alebrije are going to do together.

                            Place the 4 eggs, margarine, salt, and half of the sugar in the mixer bowl. Using the paddle
                            attachment start working the dough for about 2 minutes.
                            Add the all-purpose flour in small amounts alternating with the water. Add the dry active
                            yeast and mix until well combined.

                        <li>
                            Continue now by adding one at a time the butter, the orange zest, the rest of the sugar and
                            the orange blossom essence, mixing well
                            after each addition until soft dough forms.

                        <li>
                            Get the dough out of the mixer bowl and place it onto the work surface; knead until smooth,
                            dusting
                            the work surface lightly with flour as needed if the dough begins to stick. Knead for a
                            couple
                            more minutes. Coat the interior of a large bowl with margarine; transfer
                            the dough to the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until it
                            doubles in
                            size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

                            Transfer the dough from the bowl onto the working surface, and separate 300 grams of the
                            dough to
                            form the decorative bones later on. Cut the rest of the dough into 70 grams. pieces or in
                            two
                            equal pieces if making 2 large pieces of bread.
                            (Make sure to separate 300 grams of dough to form the decorative bones.). Prepare 2

                        <li>
                            Take one portion of the dough and place it in the palm of your hand, we put our fingers in
                            and
                            add a bit of pressure and shape each piece into a tight ball rolling the dough on the
                            surface. This is called “bolear” in Spanish (if, at first they do not look fine to you, do
                            not worry you will achieve this with practice) Place on prepared baking sheets 2 inches
                            apart. Press the dough slightly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now place the remaining 300 grams of dough we reserved onto the work surface, dusting with
                            flour if needed, and knead until the flour is integrated perfectly (this is for the bones to
                            decorate our pieces of bread).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We take small portions of dough and roll them in small logs putting a little pressure on the
                            fingers to form the bones. Once your bones are already formed (we need 2 for each bread).
                            Brush each roll forming a cross on top of each bun with a mix made out of the remaining
                            beaten egg with 1 Tablespoon of water, once we marked the cross with the brush we place the
                            bones as shown in the above picture, cutting any extra dough.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            And finally, with the leftover dough from small balls, varnish the center of the buns where
                            the bones come together and put the ball there as shown in the picture. Cover baking sheets
                            with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until buns are touching and doubled in size,
                            1 ½ to 2 hours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add a pinch of salt to our mix of egg and water and brush the buns before placing them in
                            the
                            oven. Transfer buns to the oven and bake until golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes,
                            approximately, if
                            making the small buns. If you are making the larger version the baking time will change a
                            little. Remember that every oven is different, (when the bottom of the bread is golden it
                            indicates that they are ready). Transfer to a wire rack and cool to room temperature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once your Pan de Muerto bread has completely cooled brush it with the remaining butter and
                            then dust with sugar.
