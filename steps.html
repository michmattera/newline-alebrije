                    <p>The 1st of November is the only day per year where you can get your alebrije.
                        <br>
                        From a specific location in Mexico, a portal and a magical bridge made out of :

                        <strong>"La flor de cempasúchil "</strong>

                        A yellow flower very common in Mexico, open just on that day.
                        <br>
                        From that bridge you will see arrive your Alebrije, and if you want as well your relatives from
                        the other world.
                        That is why you will have to be patient and wait for that day.

        <div class="instruction">
            <h2 class="main-title blue">Make an altar!</h2>
            <p>You wil have to make an altar to make a connection with the other world, so that your alebrije (and as
                well the people you lost)
                can pass the bridge and actually arrive in your house safely.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Altar</h3>
            <p>An altar is a place where you make a connection with the other world. You do it using the four elements,
                like the elements
                of the alebrijes: <strong>Air</strong>, <strong>Fire</strong>, <strong>Earth</strong>, and
                <strong>Water</strong>.
                It is usually in your house, and is divided in three different levels that represent : Heaven, Earth and
                the World of the Death.
                I am going to show how to make an altar in different steps or if you want you can follow the video
                below!
            </p>
            <iframe class="video" width="700" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6YNe5CB8qxs" control

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Base of the altar</h4>
                    <image>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                    </image>
                    <p>The base on the altar is what you are going to use to prepare the
                        altar in your house or where you have decided to wait for your alebrije.
                        <br>
                        You can simply use a table or a desk for the first and central level.
                        <br>
                        To do the top level you can place any object that is rigid and can sostein weight as
                        for example a box or a few books together.
                        <br>
                        The third and bottom level you can use a box or even a old laggage will be okay.
                        <br>
                        The most important thing is that all the surface are flat. Now you can cover all the surface
                        with
                        what you have in your house, just to not see the difference of level under it. You can either
                        use a blanket
                        or you can buy something related with the day of the death!
                        <br>
                        Just have fun and use something you like!</p>

                    <h4>La flor de cempasúchil</h4>

                    </image>
                    <p>
                        This flower , which grow mostly in October and November according to traditions,is also 
                        called the flower of the dead, flower of the twenty petals or cempasuchil flower. 
                        <br>
                        It is considered since pre-Hispanic times as a symbol of life and death.
                        <br>
                        You are going to need this flower and the petals of the cempasúchil flower  to create paths and 
                         guide the alebrije and the deceased to the altar that you are building.
                         <br>
                         It is a flower that connects the open portal from the realm of the death to the mortal world to your house.
                         <br>
                         That is why you need this flower in your altar and why is so important.
                         <br>
                         You can place the flowers a bit everywhere in the altar but the important part is that you make a path with
                          the petals from the altar for at least 1 meter.
